
   Welcome to the Aftermath Soundpack. We do hope this will be simple enough and easy enough for you to find your play all the more enjoyable.
   The Aftermath Soundpack 6.1 originally created by unknown persons that had constructed it for Hellmoo, and then had been modified for Infurno, just to finally end up in our laps and being redubbed once again to the title Aftermath by our very own Paul Balfe.


Step 1: Unzip the folders and place them in your Documents if you could.
Step 2: Copy the Aftermath folder containing the Script Files. Paste this folder in your VIP Mud in your Documents, replacing the current Aftermath Folder existing.
Step 3: Copy the folder titled Aftermath inside the Sounds folder of the Sound pack. Paste this in your Sounds folder in VIP Mud in your Documents. 
Final Step: Restart your VIP Mud Instances and fire it up, Enjoy!

Note: This pack currently only has a Read Me folder for VIP 2.0 and not 1.1 as of this point. This will be remedied soon.
